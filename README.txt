This is where you will upload and work on files.

Git is a very nice content manager usually used for text and code-based  files. We will be using it for art, mainly for the reasons of unlimited "storage" space, ease of use, and version control.

------How to Use: ----------------------

1.) When you open up GitHub, be sure to sync to get the latest changes from the server.

2.) Perform any changes that you need to.

3.) When you are done working, commit the changes to the directory and add a Commit Description. The limit is 50 characters, so if you need more space to describe what more you did, use the Extended Description.

4.) When you have done that, sync back up with the server so that other people can access the changes you made.
