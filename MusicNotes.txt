We need voice acting for the grunts, groans, and sounds of exertion from the characters.

The birds could be louder and there could be a variation in sound.

THe sounds feel weak and low quality, we want it to be punchier and feel like he hits.

Human sounds every second. Light music in the background to accent things.
